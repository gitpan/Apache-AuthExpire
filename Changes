Revision history for Perl extension Apache::AuthExpire
0.39  Thursday July 29, 2004
	- bcw - Modified to account for proxy redirection that could result in 
          the get_remote_host() fctn always returning 127.0.0.1. 
	  <changes noted below>
  - bcw - I have modified the module to return DECLINED rather than 
          OK. This allows other various authenTication schemes to operate.
	  <changes noted below>
  - bcw - Added a new configuration PerlSetVar variable "TimeoutPurge".
          This variable specifies the number of hours to wait before 
          considering a timeout file to be too old to have come from the 
          same session. This allows for someone to successfully use the 
          AuthExpire to implement session timeouts and clean up old 
          authentication timeout files after an extended period of time has
          elapsed.   
  - speeves - updated my contact information and included Brandon's patches
            - fixed README and added up-to-date information
	    - Added PerlSetVar variable 'AllowAlternateAuth' 
	      to allow for you to chain authenhandlers...
	    - moved the dir_config variable declarations to the top of the
	      handler subroutine and cleaned up the code that needed it in
	      response to these changes
	    - modified proxy patch to check for _any_ proxy server and return
	      "real" client address
	    - added PerlSetVar variable 'TimeFileDir' to allow you to 
	      specify an alternate location for your timeout files
	    - added a lot of documentation with more information on 
	      each feature, as well as installation information.
	    - changed the timeout file default directory to 
	      <SERVERROOT>/logs/authexpire
	    - updated the README to reflect the new changes.
