1.  Purpose

	As the title suggests, this PerlAuthenHandler will provide a means to set a server wide time out
system for servers that contain sensitive data.  It does this by using file modification times in a times 
directory in <SERVERROOT>/conf/ to determine when an access_controlled request was made last, and if too 
much time has passed since the last request, the module will return a status code of AUTH_REQUIRED to
the browser to force a login.  It follows the rules of the AUTHENTICATION phase and standard
PerlAuthenHandlers.

2.  Usage

	The usage is pretty simple:
		1.  Install module using 'perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install'.
		2.  Place the following lines in your <SERVERROOT>/conf/httpd.conf file, where appropriate:
			PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthExpire
			PerlSetVar  DefaultLimit <number of seconds for default timeout>
		3.  The following line, optional in your httpd.conf file, will turn on debugging reports to
		    your error_log (set by the httpd.conf file):
			PerlSetVar TIMEOUT_DEBUG 1
		4.  The following lines allow site maintainers to turn off timeouts for a directory or 
		    change the value.  The value of the TimeLimit directive must be less than the 
		    DefaultLimit.  These are optional in the .htaccess file:
			PerlSetVar TimeLimit <number of seconds for this directory timeout>
			PerlSetVar MODE Off
		5.  After setting these, all directories will be subject to the PerlAuthenHandler if an
		    .htaccess file is present, the AuthType must be set to 'Basic', the AuthName must be
		    defined, at least one 'require' directive defined, and MODE is not set.
		6.  Create a directory in your <SERVERROOT>/conf directory named 'times' and change 
		    ownership to the user:group running the Apache child processes.
		7.  Stop and restart the web server.

4.  TODO List

	* Rewrite so that instead of a 401 (which isn't handled well by all browsers) with a page
	  allowing another login.  This will have to be addressed by browsers and should work.
	* Work on Makefile generation so that the module goes to <SERVERROOT>/lib/perl/Apache/
	* Determine better debugging mode so that debug will actually be useful
	* General cleanup
	* Generate better method of creating <SERVERROOT>/conf/times directory
